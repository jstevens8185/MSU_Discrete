/*
INTRO TO BITWISE OPERATORS
The purpose of this code is to introduce the use of
bitwise operators to examine particular bits.  
The 4 rightmost bits of an unsignedinteger variable 
are used to represent states of a printer as
indicated in the #defines.

If the number stored in the variable is 13, (bits of 1101)
that would indicate:

Power on
Paper Loaded
Two Sided Printing enabled
